--- Simple Linear Regression (Price vs. Area) ---
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1474748.13
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3675286604768.19
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1917103.70
R-squared (R²): 0.2729
Coefficient (Area): 425.73
Intercept: 2512254.26


Interpretation of Simple Linear Regression Coefficient:
For every one unit increase in 'area', the 'price' is predicted to increase by 425.73, assuming a linear relationship.

Interpretation of Multiple Linear Regression Coefficients:
Each coefficient indicates the expected change in 'price' for a one-unit increase in the corresponding feature, holding all other features constant.
For example, a positive coefficient for 'airconditioning' suggests that houses with air conditioning tend to be more expensive, all else being equal.
The R-squared value of the multiple linear regression model is generally higher than the simple linear regression, indicating that more features help explain more variance in house prices.
