### **5. (Optional) Add a custom domain**
If you deploy from Lovable or elsewhere, attach a custom domain so no `.lovable.app` URL appears:  
1. Go to **Project → Settings → Domains → Connect Domain**.  
2. Add your domain and update your DNS records as instructed.

### Do you want me to **give you this as a ready-to-download ZIP** containing:  
- the cleaned-up README.md  
- instructions inside a single text file  
- sample `index.html` with title updated?  
Or should I **directly generate the fixed project files (ready to push to GitHub)?**
